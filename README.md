## üìù Project Overview

The **Interactive Quiz Application** is a web-based platform that allows users to test their knowledge by answering a series of multiple-choice questions. It offers immediate feedback for each answer and displays a dynamic scorecard at the end of the quiz. This project is designed to improve user engagement and learning efficiency through an interactive and visually clean interface.

This application was developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, ensuring no external frameworks or libraries were used. It follows a modular structure and responsive design principles, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Upon launching the application, users are presented with a **Start Quiz** button. Once clicked, the quiz begins and displays one question at a time with multiple-choice options. After the user selects an option, the application immediately highlights whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect, providing **real-time feedback**. The user then proceeds to the next question.

After all questions are answered, the application presents a **Scorecard** that summarizes the user‚Äôs performance. It shows the number of correct answers out of the total questions attempted and may include a message based on performance (e.g., "Great job!" or "Keep practicing!").

All questions, options, and answers are stored in a JavaScript object/array, allowing easy scalability and management of the quiz content. The code is written with reusability in mind, separating logic from UI rendering.

This project showcases skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, dynamic HTML rendering, and maintaining quiz state across multiple steps. The visual design was done using CSS, with emphasis on user experience, button animations, responsive layout, and feedback colors (green for correct, red for wrong).

The application was version-controlled using **Git**, and finally deployed using **GitHub Pages** to make it publicly accessible.
